     "Description": "What it is:\n\nAn ergonomic eyelash curler that gently bends and lengthens the lashes.\n\n\n\nWhat it does:\n\n The award-winning Surratt Beauty Relevée Lash Curler creates eye-opening, elongated, beautifully-fanned lashes with zero breakage or pinching. Its hand-calibrated Japanese design and bouncy silicone pads require less force, so this cult favorite gracefully lifts, bends, and extends.\n\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\n Surratt Beauty is dedicated to the Japanese tradition of minimal elegance; the space-saving packaging is designed to be lightweight and secure, and it is recyclable.\n\n\n\nBeauty tip:\nApply it as close to the lash line as comfortably possible and give it a gentle squeeze. Then, pull it out about a millimeter and give it another gentle squeeze, then one more millimeter and a final squeeze. That’s three gentle squeezes in total. But by moving very subtly along the way, so you get a gently uplifted lash that’s not crimped at a 45 degree angle.",

Silk extracts feel nourishing on skin and diminish the look of pores, fines lines, and imperfections for the perfect canvas before makeup. Silk powder makes makeup glide on more evenly and last longer, minimizing excess shine with a soft focus finish. A protective layer derived from botanicals acts as a barrier between makeup and skin, helping to prevent clogged pores that can lead to breakouts. Anti-pollution natural active ingredients fight immediate attack from environmental stressors and help support the skin’s barrier function to act against future attack, visibly reducing the appearance of wrinkles and dullness. Pink and gold pearl helps even skin tone for a healthy look, and hadasei-3—a trinity of Japanese superfoods green tea, rice, and algae—visibly restores youthful radiance.\n\n\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\nThis product is noncomedogenic, non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, cruelty-free, and formulated without synthetic fragrances, mineral oil, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, or TEA. \n\n\n\nThe journey of The Silk Canvas to you: the final step of the geisha’s skincare ritual—and the beginning of her makeup—is to press a thin layer of melted Japanese wax called Bintsuke into her skin. This soft layer creates a smooth, poreless canvas to help her makeup last all day and protect her skin beneath. Tatcha brings a modern evolution of this time-honored practice to life in The Silk Canvas.\n\n\n\nBeauty that gives back: every Tatcha purchase you make supports girls’ education around the world. Tatcha is proud to partner with Room to Read to transform girls’ futures.—Victoria Tsai, Founder\n\n\nResearch results:\n- 100% of subjects agreed that their skin felt smoother immediately after application\n\n\nAfter 2 weeks:\n- 100% of subjects agreed after using the primer that their skin felt soft, fresh, and natural, more even-toned, younger, and healthier, and their makeup applied more smoothly\n- 95% of subjects agreed after using the primer that their skin had a healthy glow, a soft \"filter finish\" look even without makeup, their skin had a satin finish, and their foundation had better coverage\n- 90% of subjects agreed after using the primer that their makeup did not crease and that they would wear the primer alone without makeup\n\n\nClean at Sephora\n When you spot our Clean seal, you can be sure we’ve checked that this brand’s product is made without the ingredients you told us you’d most like to avoid. \n\nClean at Sephora™ is formulated without: \nSulfates SLS and SLES, parabens, formaldehydes, formaldehyde-releasing agents, phthalates, mineral oil, retinyl palmitate, oxybenzone, coal tar, hydroquinone, Triclosan, Triclocarban.

     "Description": "What it is:\nA high-volume mascara with nourishing cannabis oil, thickening heart-shaped fibers, and pure pigments for a clump-free, intense black finish.\n\nWhat it does:\n KUSH High Volume Mascara’s unique heart-shaped fibers lock onto lashes for long-lasting volume, length, and curl. Unlike gangly, cylindrical fibers that can appear spidery, these hollow heart-shaped fibers lay on your lashes in each direction, creating the look of length and width. Conditioning cannabis oil fuses to lashes for thickness without fallout, while also working to fill the hollow, heart-shaped fibers with formula for a double dose of volume. Hemp-derived cannabis oil continues to hydrate for healthier-looking lashes, even after you’ve removed your mascara.\n\nWiggle the tapered, tree-shaped brush to hit every angle—the narrow top reaches the inner and outer corners and bottom lashes, while the fuller body takes care of the rest. The crisscrossed, soft-medium firm bristles wrap and coat each lash for clump-free definition.\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n- Parabens\n- Sulfates\n- Phthalates\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n KUSH Mascara is cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, and gluten-free.\n\n Why formulate with cannabis? Ever since its inception, Milk Makeup has wanted to create a product that showcases the amazing properties of cannabis oil. When they started talking about coming out with a fully vegan volumizing mascara with fibers, they knew they couldn't use beeswax, a common binding component in mascara formulas. Enter: cannabis oil. Hemp-derived cannabis oil fuses the heart-shaped fibers to your lashes without fallout. It whips the formula into a creamy texture that allows for smoother application on lashes and an easier, tug-free removal. It also provides an additional conditioning benefit. KUSH Mascara is the vegan way to get major volume and healthier-looking lashes in one hit.\n\nResearch results:\nIn a test conducted on 21 women:\n- 95% saw high volume\n- 95% saw longer lashes\n- 90% saw thicker lashes\n- 90% saw lifted lashes",

Hourglass’s original collection of Ambient® Lighting Blush fuses universally flattering Ambient Lighting Powders with vivid cheek colors for soft-focus, multidimensional color with a naturally radiant finish.

The result is skin that looks smooth, even, and enhanced—not masked. The soft-focus technology helps to minimize the look of wrinkles and imperfections, neutralize discoloration, and emulate the appearance of young, healthy skin.\n\n\"Traditional blush can read as flat, and so I was inspired to create something that was far more seamless. The Ambient Lighting Blush Collection fuses two advanced formulas to create something entirely new.

The large, rounded surface area ensures a quick application while the contoured tip offers precision. \n\nbeautyblender has chosen to use non-toxic, water-soluble dyes. For this reason, your beautyblender may shed dye for the first couple of washes—similar to a pair of blue jeans. Once you squeeze the water out of the beautyblender, the excess dye is removed as well. The dye does not transfer to the skin.\n\nThis product is a nine-time Allure Best of Beauty award winner.

This palette features Sheer Glow Filter Powder, a brand new, skin-smoothing powder, in four different finishes designed to blur, brighten, contour, and add a radiant flush of color. Microfine, luminescent pigments diffuse light to soften the look of skin and blurring pigments even skin’s texture so light bounces off it more effortlessly. The light-as-air, buildable shades brighten, blur, and softly define the complexion to create a sheer, natural glow—effortlessly. Unlike heavier powders, the oil-absorbing formula retouches and sets without disrupting makeup, making it your perfect 3pm-pick-me-up in a palette.\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n- Parabens\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n BECCA knows glow. Their products are known to deliver intense beams of light, and now they’re delivering their newest form of glow—a low-light, soft luminescence. This innovative formula manipulates light in two ways. Blurring pigments minimize the appearance of imperfections and pores, evening skin’s texture so light can bounce of it more effortlessly while microfine, luminescent pigments diffuse and scatter light to soften the look of skin. The result is photo filter effect in real life. Each shade contains a unique blend of pearl and pigment for four different finishes. Use the shades alone or swirl them together to customize your glow.\n\nEach palette includes one of eight aspirational mantras written on the mirror to guide you to find your inner light. Which mantra chooses you? Share your mantra and your looks with #BECCABeALight.\n\nChoose the palette with the shades that bring out your skin tone’s unique glow (each sold separately):\n\nLight to Medium Palette:\n- Brighten Powder (left shade): A soft pearl with a hint of luminosity that brightens the complexion.\n- Blur Powder (right shade): A flattering beige with a satin finish that mimics the look of skin, blurs imperfections, and warms the complexion.\n- Contour (bottom rectangular shade): A neutral tan shade to enhance and define your features.\n- Blush (top rectangular shade): A light pink marbled with pearl for a pop of color and light.\n\nMedium to Deep Palette:\n- Brighten Powder: A neutral peach with a hint of luminosity that brightens the complexion.\n- Blur Powder: A warm sand shade with satin finish that mimics the look of skin, blurs imperfections, and enhances the complexion.\n- Contour: A warm bronze shade that creates natural dimension.\n- Blush: A warm copper marbled with rose gold pearl for a pop of color and light.\n\nBeauty Tips:\nUse these shades after foundation to set and enhance your complexion, or use them instead of foundation to create a sheer, natural finish. \n\nFor lighter skin tones, use Contour as an eyeshadow and Blur Powder as a warming bronzer where sun would naturally kiss the skin. For deeper skin tones, mix Contour with Brighten and Blur to achieve a customized rich shade.",

Its jumbo size provides the application of a lipstick with the convenience of an artist pencil, and the tapered end is perfect for lining, defining, and filling in lips. Its non-drying formula is enriched with vitamin E and emollients for a creamy texture, while a blend of unique silicones ensures long-lasting, seamless matte color for hours. Just pair it with another lip product for added dimension or as a tinted base. Whether it’s soft and neutral or bold and edgy, this lip pencil is ideal for making a lip statement.\n\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\n This product works best with the NARS Pencil Sharpener; other sharpeners may be harmful or damaging.\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to create a modern way to wear a very classic matte lip. The creaminess of the texture makes them very easy to wear.\"—François Nars, Founder and Creative Director of NARS Cosmetics\n\n\n\n\"Lips are all about fun. Virtually every color can work on everyone. Paired with a soft eye, even the darkest or brightest shade of lip color can create a striking makeup look on its own. With lips more than any other features, I follow a no rules approach.\"—François Nars\n\n\n\n\n \"Using these as a base for any other lip product makes your color wear much longer. They glide on super easy and stay put!\"—Lisa LeSeur, NARS National Makeup Stylist\n\n\n\n\"I love using Velvet Matte Lip Pencils together to create dimension on the lip—try one shade for lining and another for filling in.\"—Shayna Shapiro, NARS Lead Trainer",

No two look alike.\n\nThe Ambient® Lighting Blush Collection features airy, lightweight blushes to flatter a range of skin tones. Hourglass’s original collection of Ambient® Lighting Blush fuses universally flattering Ambient Lighting Powders with vivid cheek colors for soft-focus, multidimensional color with a naturally radiant finish. The new collection of Ambient Strobe Lighting Blush fuses the illuminating effects of Ambient Strobe Lighting Powder with modern color to brighten cheeks for glowing, lit-from-within color with a shimmer finish. \n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n- Parabens\n- Sulfates\n- Phthalates\n\nWhat else you need to know:\nThe optically transparent particles alter the appearance of the skin by manipulating and refracting favorable light. The result is skin that looks smooth, even, and enhanced—not masked. The soft-focus technology helps to minimize the look of wrinkles and imperfections, neutralize discoloration, and emulate the appearance of young, healthy skin.\n\n\"Traditional blush can read as flat, and so I was inspired to create something that was far more seamless. The Ambient Lighting Blush Collection fuses two advanced formulas to create something entirely new.

     "Description": "What it is:\n\nA tinted, vegan brow gel formulated with thickening, heart-shaped fibers and conditioning cannabis oil for long-lasting fullness, shape, and definition.\n\n\n\nWhat it does:\n\n Do something dope for your brows. KUSH Fiber Brow Gel is for anyone looking to add some oomph to their brows. It’s packed with tinted, thickening, heart-shaped fibers that adhere to skin and hair for long-lasting fullness, shape, and definition. The hollow fibers are also filled with formula for another dose of volume. Cannabis oil fuses the heart-shaped fibers to brows for thickness without flaking. Like a hair mask for your brows, nourishing, cannabis oil also conditions, sets, and won’t cause stiffness. The tapered, tree-shaped brush with dense, firm bristles allows you to deposit gel evenly across your brows so each hair stays put.\n\n\n\nThe transfer-proof formula comes in three shades that adjust to work across all hair colors. \n\n\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n\n- Parabens\n\n- Sulfates\n\n- Phthalates\n\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\n KUSH Fiber Brow Gel is cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, and gluten-free. \n\n\n\nWhy is it formulated with cannabis? First came KUSH Mascara. MILK MAKEUP has now ventured into brow territory with KUSH Fiber Brow Gel. Because the brand is 100 percent vegan, they knew they couldn’t use beeswax, a common binding component in brow gel formulas. So, they went back to their vegan formula hero, cannabis oil. It fuses the tinted, thickening, heart-shaped fibers to your brows without stiffness or flaking, and whips the formula into a creamy texture that allows for smoother application. It also provides an additional conditioning benefit for healthier-looking brows. KUSH Fiber Brow Gel is the vegan way to get fuller-looking brows in one hit.",

Designed with exclusive beautyblender® material, now available in the best-loved pro color—black, and one fourth the size of the original sponge, these non-disposable micro.mini sponges are the perfect tool for concealing small areas. Use it for your concealing, highlighting, contouring, and color correcting needs. They can also be used to apply darker-toned products that would be difficult to rinse clean from a lighter-colored applicator.\n\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\nThe aqua-activated sponge grows to about twice its size and absorbs minimal product so your favorite formula lands on your complexion, not your sponge. When wet, the super soft material provides an even, smooth blend and bounce. The large, rounded surface area ensures a quick application, while the contoured tip offers precision. \n\n\nbeautyblender has chosen to use non-toxic, water-soluble dyes. For this reason, your beautyblender may shed dye for the first couple of washes—similar to a pair of blue jeans. Once you squeeze the water out of the beautyblender, the excess dye is removed as well. The dye does not transfer to the skin.\n\nHand finished in the USA.",

A protective layer derived from botanicals acts as a barrier between makeup and skin, helping to prevent clogged pores that can lead to breakouts. Anti-pollution natural active ingredients fight immediate attack from environmental stressors and help support the skin’s barrier function to act against future attack, visibly reducing the appearance of wrinkles and dullness.

Tatcha brings a modern evolution of this time-honored practice to life in The Silk Canvas.\n\n\n\nBeauty that gives back: every Tatcha purchase you make supports girls’ education around the world.

For this reason, your beautyblender may shed dye for the first couple of washes—similar to a pair of blue jeans. Once you squeeze the water out of the beautyblender, the excess dye is removed as well. The dye does not transfer to the skin.\n\nHand finished in the USA.",

Unlike gangly, cylindrical fibers that can appear spidery, these hollow heart-shaped fibers lay on your lashes in each direction, creating the look of length and width. Conditioning cannabis oil fuses to lashes for thickness without fallout, while also working to fill the hollow, heart-shaped fibers with formula for a double dose of volume. Hemp-derived cannabis oil continues to hydrate for healthier-looking lashes, even after you’ve removed your mascara.\n\nWiggle the tapered, tree-shaped brush to hit every angle—the narrow top reaches the inner and outer corners and bottom lashes, while the fuller body takes care of the rest. The crisscrossed, soft-medium firm bristles wrap and coat each lash for clump-free definition.\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n- Parabens\n- Sulfates\n- Phthalates\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n KUSH Mascara is cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, and gluten-free.\n\n Why formulate with cannabis? Ever since its inception, Milk Makeup has wanted to create a product that showcases the amazing properties of cannabis oil. When they started talking about coming out with a fully vegan volumizing mascara with fibers, they knew they couldn't use beeswax, a common binding component in mascara formulas. Enter: cannabis oil. Hemp-derived cannabis oil fuses the heart-shaped fibers to your lashes without fallout. It whips the formula into a creamy texture that allows for smoother application on lashes and an easier, tug-free removal. It also provides an additional conditioning benefit. KUSH Mascara is the vegan way to get major volume and healthier-looking lashes in one hit.\n\nResearch results:\nIn a test conducted on 21 women:\n- 95% saw high volume\n- 95% saw longer lashes\n- 90% saw thicker lashes\n- 90% saw lifted lashes",

This palette features Sheer Glow Filter Powder, a brand new, skin-smoothing powder, in four different finishes designed to blur, brighten, contour, and add a radiant flush of color. Microfine, luminescent pigments diffuse light to soften the look of skin and blurring pigments even skin’s texture so light bounces off it more effortlessly. The light-as-air, buildable shades brighten, blur, and softly define the complexion to create a sheer, natural glow—effortlessly. Unlike heavier powders, the oil-absorbing formula retouches and sets without disrupting makeup, making it your perfect 3pm-pick-me-up in a palette.\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n- Parabens\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n BECCA knows glow. Their products are known to deliver intense beams of light, and now they’re delivering their newest form of glow—a low-light, soft luminescence. This innovative formula manipulates light in two ways. Blurring pigments minimize the appearance of imperfections and pores, evening skin’s texture so light can bounce of it more effortlessly while microfine, luminescent pigments diffuse and scatter light to soften the look of skin. The result is photo filter effect in real life. Each shade contains a unique blend of pearl and pigment for four different finishes. Use the shades alone or swirl them together to customize your glow.\n\nEach palette includes one of eight aspirational mantras written on the mirror to guide you to find your inner light. Which mantra chooses you? Share your mantra and your looks with #BECCABeALight.\n\nChoose the palette with the shades that bring out your skin tone’s unique glow (each sold separately):\n\nLight to Medium Palette:\n- Brighten Powder (left shade): A soft pearl with a hint of luminosity that brightens the complexion.\n- Blur Powder (right shade): A flattering beige with a satin finish that mimics the look of skin, blurs imperfections, and warms the complexion.\n- Contour (bottom rectangular shade): A neutral tan shade to enhance and define your features.\n- Blush (top rectangular shade): A light pink marbled with pearl for a pop of color and light.\n\nMedium to Deep Palette:\n- Brighten Powder: A neutral peach with a hint of luminosity that brightens the complexion.\n- Blur Powder: A warm sand shade with satin finish that mimics the look of skin, blurs imperfections, and enhances the complexion.\n- Contour: A warm bronze shade that creates natural dimension.\n- Blush: A warm copper marbled with rose gold pearl for a pop of color and light.\n\nBeauty Tips:\nUse these shades after foundation to set and enhance your complexion, or use them instead of foundation to create a sheer, natural finish. \n\nFor lighter skin tones, use Contour as an eyeshadow and Blur Powder as a warming bronzer where sun would naturally kiss the skin. For deeper skin tones, mix Contour with Brighten and Blur to achieve a customized rich shade.",

     "Description": "What it is:\n\n\nA first-of-its-kind, long-wearing, water-resistant liquid eyeliner specially designed for the waterline.\n\n\n\nWhat it does:\n\n Introducing the first liquid liner for your waterline.* Lash Liner revolutionizes the way you line your eyes with an innovative, new, long-wear, water-resistant formula, specially designed for a notoriously difficult area to get extreme pigment payoff that lasts. Finally, get all of the intensity of a liquid eyeliner, without any of the running, smudging, or raccoon-eye effect associated with traditional pencil waterliners. Lash Liner glides on and quickly dries down for all-day performance.\n\n\n\nLash Liner’s Hybrid Fluid-Gel formula contains clay binding ingredients for a richer texture than a standard liquid liner. This unique formulation is designed to stand up to watery eyes. This super-pigmented formula will set in as little as 15 seconds for transfer-resistant, long wear. Lash Liner’s soft-tip applicator is custom designed to hold the perfect amount of formula, so you can instantly intensify any eye look with extreme precision and ease. \n\n\n\n*Among leading US brands.\n\n\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n\n- Parabens\n\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\n Kat Von D created this product because she loves the look of eyeliner on the waterline, but hasn’t been able to find a product that performs. She spent four years formulating and testing dozens of different liners to finally land Lash Liner.\n\n\n\nThis product is vegan and cruelty-free.",

KUSH Fiber Brow Gel is for anyone looking to add some oomph to their brows. It’s packed with tinted, thickening, heart-shaped fibers that adhere to skin and hair for long-lasting fullness, shape, and definition. The hollow fibers are also filled with formula for another dose of volume. Cannabis oil fuses the heart-shaped fibers to brows for thickness without flaking. Like a hair mask for your brows, nourishing, cannabis oil also conditions, sets, and won’t cause stiffness. The tapered, tree-shaped brush with dense, firm bristles allows you to deposit gel evenly across your brows so each hair stays put.\n\n\n\nThe transfer-proof formula comes in three shades that adjust to work across all hair colors. \n\n\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n\n- Parabens\n\n- Sulfates\n\n- Phthalates\n\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\n KUSH Fiber Brow Gel is cruelty-free, paraben-free, vegan, and gluten-free. \n\n\n\nWhy is it formulated with cannabis? First came KUSH Mascara. MILK MAKEUP has now ventured into brow territory with KUSH Fiber Brow Gel. Because the brand is 100 percent vegan, they knew they couldn’t use beeswax, a common binding component in brow gel formulas. So, they went back to their vegan formula hero, cannabis oil. It fuses the tinted, thickening, heart-shaped fibers to your brows without stiffness or flaking, and whips the formula into a creamy texture that allows for smoother application. It also provides an additional conditioning benefit for healthier-looking brows. KUSH Fiber Brow Gel is the vegan way to get fuller-looking brows in one hit.",

Then, pull it out about a millimeter and give it another gentle squeeze, then one more millimeter and a final squeeze. That’s three gentle squeezes in total. But by moving very subtly along the way, so you get a gently uplifted lash that’s not crimped at a 45 degree angle.",

     "Description": "What it is:\nA collection of six universally-flattering finishing powders that recreate the most flattering light.\n\n\nWhat it does:\nCreate the perfect illumination for your face with Hourglass Ambient® Lighting Powder. Infused with the innovative Photoluminescent Technology, each finishing powder captures, diffuses, and softens the look of the skin. The micron-size, color-correcting particles refract light and create transparent coverage, filtering out harsh light and refining the appearance of the skin.\n\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n- Parabens\n\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n“I learned early on how different types of light can truly flatter the complexion. Growing up, my mother had pink light bulbs in all of the lamps throughout the house. She loved pink light because it was the softest and most flattering, and she always wanted to look good. I used this concept of lighting in Ambient Lighting Powder.”—Carisa Janes, Hourglass Founder\n\n\n\nAmbient® Lighting Powder comes in six shades:\n\nEthereal Light: An opalescent sheer, cool white powder that mimics a moonlit glow, even in broad daylight.\n\nDiffused Light: A soft, warm, pale yellow powder that conceals redness and gives skin clarity like a soft ray of morning light.\n\nDim Light: A neutral peach beige powder that blurs imperfections and highlights a radiant complexion with the perfect balance of warm and cool tones.\n\nMood Light: A soft, sheer lavender pink powder that mimics the softest, most forgiving light and brightens the complexion.\n\nLuminous Light: A champagne pearl powder that creates a soft, incandescent candlelit glow—day or night.\n\nRadiant Light: A sun-kissed golden beige that enhances the overall complexion with believable, subtle warmth, and also extends a summer glow.\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n\nHourglass products are 100 percent cruelty-free.",

It's perfect for darker-toned products that would be difficult to rinse clean from a lighter-colored applicator. Use it with complexion products, long-wear makeup, and self-tanners for flawless results.\n\nWhat it is formulated WITHOUT:\n- Parabens\n- Sulfates\n- Phthalates\n\nWhat else you need to know:\n The aqua-activated™ sponge grows to about twice its size and absorbs minimal product, so your favorite formula lands on your complexion, not your sponge. When wet, the super-soft material provides an even, smooth blend and bounce. The large, rounded surface area ensures a quick application while the contoured tip offers precision. \n\nbeautyblender has chosen to use non-toxic, water-soluble dyes. For this reason, your beautyblender may shed dye for the first couple of washes—similar to a pair of blue jeans. Once you squeeze the water out of the beautyblender, the excess dye is removed as well. The dye does not transfer to the skin.\n\nThis product is hand-finished in the USA.",
